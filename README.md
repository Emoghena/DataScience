# 60 Days of Udacity - DataScience Challenge

### Hi @all! I am Jens and this is my diary for my 60 days of udacity challenge for the Data Track Scholarship. I pledged to work through the foundations course for at least 30 mins every days and this git will document my work. I started this challenge on December 11, 2020.

What can I say: When udacity asked us to take the pledge to study for 30 minutes every day, I was already through with the course. So I decided to do the course again and coded the examples and projects with Excel first, then with Python.

## Day 27 - 2021-01-06

:bulb: I did the project again with the same result. To rule out errors, I did the project again with sklearn and got the same result.
I put the Diamond Project done with Python, statsmodel and sklearn in my github which you can find here:<br/>
https://github.com/jegali/DataScience/blob/main/Lesson-4/Lesson-4.ipynb<br/><br/>

:bulb: Finally I found the time to install KNIME, and I did not regret it so far. Its use is as simple as alteryx, not so stylish but can do the same and is free. Attached you see a screenshot of the diamond project. It gives me the same prediction like my python code and has the same deviation of 0,09% to alteryx. So I believe, alteryx uses a different algorithm which may cause the deviation.

## Day 26 - 2021-01-05

:bulb: As promised, I coded the example from lesson 3-22 "Building your First Model in Alteryx" in Python and statsmodel. If you are interested, have a look at the source code at:<br/>
https://github.com/jegali/DataScience/blob/main/Lesson-3-22/Lesson-3-22.ipynb<br/><br/>

:bulb: D26: I did the Diamond practice project in Python with statsmodel and think I'm close to the recommended solution. Instead of $8,230,695.69 I got $8,223,038.24. Pretty close, that's 99.91% with a deviation of 0.09%. I will check for an possible error tomorrow and try to get closer.
<br/><br/>

## Day 25 - 2021-01-04

:bulb: Today I learned Bayes theorem and Laplace probability theory. Besides that, I did the example from Lesson 3-22 in python with statsmodel with exactly the same result as before in alteryx. I will post the Python sourcecode tomorrow in my github. 
<br/><br/>

## Day 24 - 2021-01-03

:bulb: This was a day without coding. I read in my "Head First Statistics" book by O'reilly and learned about probabilities.
<br/><br/>

## Day 23 - 2021-01-02

:bulb: Today I learned the theorie behind boxplots and quartils. Good to know, you can use both to find outliers and make an educated guess about standard devation and variance.
<br/><br/>

## Day 22 - 2021-01-01

:bulb: Happy new year! I found out that there is a relationship between nominal, ordinal and metric data on the one hand and mode, median and arithmetic mean on the other. I was very fascinated by the ability to convert nominal data into ordinal data. Now I understand better the connection between dummy variables on the one hand and nominal data on the other. This will help me a lot in implementing the linear regression examples in python.

## Day 21 - 2020-12-31

:bulb: Today, I try something totally different: I have some spare raspberry Pis and connected them to a cluster. Now I try to parallelize the regression examples in python.<br/><br/>
:bulb: I finished a bootcamp on statisics and data science on udemy.

## Day 20 - 2020-12-30

:bulb: Today I did a case study in excel on portfolio management with mean value analysis, scatter analysis, correlation analysis, rank correlation, box plot, data classification and multi-regression analysis. Quite interesting to see a "real world scenario". 
<br/><br/>

## Day 19 - 2020-12-29
:bulb: I started a course on descriptive statistics with Excel. In the next days, I will transfer this knowledge to python.
<br/><br/>

## Day 18 - 2020-12-28
:bulb: I signed up to medium and read a lot of stuff. Did some experiments on dummy variables in python for a better understanding of multiple linear regression and played around with seaborn for visualization.
<br/><br/>

## Day 17 - 2020-12-27
:bulb: To bad, I realized that my slack account will delete older messages. lso found out that I cannot buy a slack account for me alone if other persons are in the channels to. So Slack wanted to charge me for a month for $17.000. I will have to reconstruct my progress from my memory

## Day 9 - 2020-12-19
## Day 8 - 2020-12-18
:bulb: I wanted to learn more about alteryx, so I did another course on udemy and passed today.
But I have to say, this course is not worth the money. If you get it discounted, it is ok.

<br/><br/>

## Day 7 - 2020-12-17 for the
:bulb: I started another alteryx-course with some real world examples, but I was disappointed.
<br/><br/>

## Day 6 - 2020-12-16
:bulb: I passed my first alteryx course on udemy today.
This course is highly recommended!

<br/><br/>

## Day 5 - 2020-12-15
:bulb: I surfed the udemy website for some courses and guess what, they actually had discounts for alteryx courses. So I decided to deepen my knowledge in that tool.

## Day 4 - 2020-12-14
## Day 3 - 2020-12-13
## Day 2 - 2020-12-12
## Day 1 - 2020-12-11
:bulb: I did the pledge and joined the slack community for the 60 days of udacity challenge. I found a lot of learning material which I sorted for further reading.
