# 60 Days of Udacity - DataScience Challenge

### Hi @all! I am Jens and this is my diary for my 60 days of udacity challenge for the Data Track Scholarship. I pledged to work through the foundations course for at least 30 mins every days and this git will document my work. I started this challenge on December 11, 2020.

What can I say: When udacity asked us to take the pledge to study for 30 minutes every day, I was already through with the course. so I decided to do the course again an code the examples and projects with Excel first, then with Python.
