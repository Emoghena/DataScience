# 60 Days of Udacity - DataScience Challenge

### Hi @all! I am Jens and this is my diary for my 60 days of udacity challenge for the Data Track Scholarship. I pledged to work through the foundations course for at least 30 mins every days and this git will document my work. I started this challenge on December 11, 2020.

What can I say: When udacity asked us to take the pledge to study for 30 minutes every day, I was already through with the course. So I decided to do the course again and coded the examples and projects with Excel first, then with Python.

## Day 27 - 2021-01-06

:bulb: I did the project again with the same result. To rule out errors, I did the project again with sklearn and got the same result.
I put the Diamond Project done with Python, statsmodel and sklearn in my github which you can find here:<br/>

:bulb: Finally I found the time to install KNIME, and I did not regret it so far. Its use is as simple as alteryx, not so stylish but can do the same and is free. Attached you see a screenshot of the diamond project. It gives me the same prediction like my python code and has the same deviation of 0,09% to alteryx. So I believe, alteryx uses a different algorithm which may cause the deviation.

## Day 26 - 2021-01-05

:bulb: As promised, I coded the example from lesson 3-22 "Building your First Model in Alteryx" in Python and statsmodel. If you are interested, have a look at the source code at:<br/>
https://github.com/jegali/DataScience/blob/main/Lesson-3-22/Lesson-3-22.ipynb<br/><br/>

:bulb: D26: I did the Diamond practice project in Python with statsmodel and think I'm close to the recommended solution. Instead of $8,230,695.69 I got $8,223,038.24. Pretty close, that's 99.91% with a deviation of 0.09%. I will check for an possible error tomorrow and try to get closer.

## Day 25 - 2021-01-04

:bulb: Today I learned Bayes theorem and Laplace probability theory. Besides that, I did the example from Lesson 3-22 in python with statsmodel with exactly the same result as before in alteryx. I will post the Python sourcecode tomorrow in my github. 

## Day 24 - 2021-01-03

:bulb: This was a day without coding. I read in my "Head First Statistics" book by O'reilly and learned about probabilities.

## Day 1 - 2020-12-11
