# 60 Days of Udacity - DataScience Challenge

### Hi @all! I am Jens and this is my diary for my 60 days of udacity challenge for the Data Track Scholarship. I pledged to work through the foundations course for at least 30 mins every days and this git will document my work. I started this challenge on December 11, 2020.

What can I say: When udacity asked us to take the pledge to study for 30 minutes every day, I was already through with the course. So I decided to do the course again and coded the examples and projects with Excel first, then with Python.

:bulb: I put the Diamond Project done with Python, statsmodel and sklearn in my github which you can find here:<br/>

:bulb: Finally I found the time to install KNIME, and I did not regret it so far. Its use is as simple as alteryx, not so stylish but can do the same and is free. Attached you see a screenshot of the diamond project. It gives me the same prediction like my python code and has the same deviation of 0,09% to alteryx. Must be alteryx's algorithm..
