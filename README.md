# 60 Days of Udacity - DataScience Challenge

### Hi @all! I am Jens and this is my diary for my 60 days of udacity challenge for the Data Track Scholarship. I pledged to work through the foundations course for at least 30 mins every days and this git will document my work. I started this challenge on December 11, 2020.

What can I say: When udacity asked us to take the pledge to study for 30 minutes every day, I was already through with the course. So I decided to do the course again and coded the examples and projects with Excel first, then with Python.

## Day 57 - 2021-02-05
:bulb: Repeated combinatorics and read about Django REST APIs.
<br/><br/>

## Day 56 - 2021-02-04
:bulb: Today I learned more about highcharts and all the options the different diagrams have. I also implemented a dark/light theme for highcharts. In the evening I tried to make the highcharts dynamic and loaded realtime data from the web, parsed it and put it in a chart. It works on my local machine and suddenly - boom - it did not show up longer on my webserver. I looked at the code but found no error. It took two episodes of GoT... Guess what? No program error. No coding mistake. Apache choked. After a restart it works again. Remember: it's not always your fault...
<br/><br/>

## Day 55 - 2021-02-03
:bulb: I found the misconfiguration and started a new install of my webapp. It already has dark/light mode, responsiveness - it works on Desktop, iPhone and Huawei P40 pro, and the first chart which reads the planetary k-index and displays as a bar chart. The service is up - only in german at the moment, but localisation is the next topic - and can be found at www.aurorafox.de. Yeay!
<br/><br/>

## Day 54 - 2021-02-02
:bulb: I created the legal pages for my webapp, then I tried to copy the files from my local django installation to my webserver. This seems to be not so straightforward and destroyed the webserver. I will try again tomorrow... it was a long day with a lot of work.
<br/><br/>

## Day 53 - 2021-02-01
:bulb: Started a data scuence bootcamp in python at udemy. Making good progress so far.
<br/><br/>

## Day 52 - 2021-01-31
:bulb: I managed to get a static barchart (chart.js) in my django/html page. After that I searched for some information to feed it with data fron the web and found an excellent video at youtube. This guy shows how to make a covid-19 (this word makes me aggressive...) dashboard with chart.js and highcharts.com. He uses a jupyter notebook for fiddling and testing and then put the code in his django website. Great! Have a look at it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRjteiImIWw
:bulb: Part two of my work: I managed to download KP-Data from Space Weather Prediction Center, parsed it and put it in a dynamically created chart. Very satisfying to see what can be done with 12 lines of python code.
<br/><br/>

## Day 51 - 2021-01-30
:bulb: I added dark/light theme switching for my Django webapp and created custom visualization components in bootstrap. CSS is still a miracle, but it is getting better every day. Now trying to query XLS/SQL to get data for my charts in python.
<br/><br/>

## Day 44 - 2021-01-23
:bulb: Study Jam!
<br/><br/>

## Day 43 - 2021-01-22
:bulb: I managed to deploy Django to an Apache2 webserver on a raspberry installation. It worked locally but always showed the standard config page when I accessed it from another device. Searched the whole evening yesterday for the error. I'm still not sure what the reason is/was: a misleading browser cache or an error in the apache config. I disabled the standard page this morning and it worked. I then took care of the DNS redirection and voila - the standard Django page is on the Internet at www.aurorafox.de. Now I will rewrite the application. Troubleshooting is very timeconsuming... In order not to run into this trap again, I have documented the processes in step-by-step instructions <br/><br/>

## Day 42 - 2021-01-21
:bulb: I continued fiddling with Django and Python. Got a simple Bootstrap page working and installed it on a raspberry. Now I try to put that all inside a apache webserver and redirect the device to one of my domains. My copy of "How charts lie" has been delivered. Something to read for the weekend. 
<br/><br/>

## Day 41 - 2021-01-20
:bulb: As Monty Python would say: "And now to something totally different"... Today, I stumbled upon Django and developed my first Python/Django Webapp. I the near future want to rewrite my android AuroraFox (Northern Light prediction and forecast) app into a Python/Django webapp to reach more users and to deepen my Python knowledge. So many things to do and so little time....<br/><br/>

## Day 40 - 2021-01-19
:bulb: I made it through lesson 2 of Udacity's tableau course https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud1006
<br/><br/>

## Day 39 - 2021-01-18
:bulb: I repeated Bayes theorem and discrete probability
<br/><br/>

## Day 38 - 2021-01-17
:bulb: I wrote a network worm in Python today for my teaching platform. Python is really great
<br/><br/>

## Day 37 - 2021-01-16
:bulb: Learning about visualization today. Some of the statistics basics were repeated in the course, leaving the quizzes as a no-brainer.
<br/><br/>

## Day 36 - 2021-01-15
:bulb:  I finished the book "Head First Statistics" and will now start with some lectures on visualization. 
<br/><br/>

## Day 35 - 2021-01-14
:bulb: I completed my statistics course<br/><br/>

## Day 34 - 2021-01-13
:bulb: I did it! Submitted my project report for lesson 5. I will post it here as well - maybe you want to have a look at it. It contains an alteryx and python solution as well: [The Predicting Catalog Demand Report](https://github.com/jegali/DataScience/blob/main/Lesson-5/P1%20-%20Predicting%20Catalog%20Demand%20-%20Jens%20Gaulke.pdf)<br/><br/>
:bulb: I also put the [alteryx project](https://github.com/jegali/DataScience/blob/main/Lesson-5/Predicting%20catalog.yxmd) in my git<br/><br/>
:bulb: Since I did the project with Python also, I also added the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jegali/DataScience/blob/main/Lesson-5/catalog-demand.ipynb) 
<br/><br/>

## Day 33 - 2021-01-12
:bulb: I'm writing the report for the lesson 5 project. Had to reactivate alteryx for some screenshots. I want to include my python jupyter notebook in the report so I think I need some more time. I think I can publish it tomorrow.<br/><br/>

## Day 32 - 2021-01-11
:bulb: Revisited and recapitulated hypothesis testing. It is much clearer now.<br/><br/>

## Day 31 - 2021-01-10
:bulb: Struggling with hypothesis testing today. Interesting, but very dry.<br/><br/>

## Day 30 - 2021-01-09
:bulb: Could not learn that much today. One of our pets died. Nevertheless, I learned something about Samples and sampling.<br/><br/>
:bulb: I'm still attending the "to p or not to p" course on coursera.<br/><br/>

## Day 29 - 2021-01-08
:bulb: Did progress on the coursera statistics course. Now I have to wait until my assignment has been evaluated.<br/><br/>

## Day 28 - 2021-01-07
:bulb: I was inspired by the work of a fellow and decided to restructure my git similarly. I added a diary but had a problem: I forgot that slack does not let us access older posts, so I will have to do some diary entries from my memory. I hope it fits with the older slack entries. Shit happens. Yesterday I started the diary, now it is up to date.<br/><br/>
:bulb: Today I started the "to p or not to p" course on coursera.<br/><br/>

## Day 27 - 2021-01-06
:bulb: I did the project again with the same result. To rule out errors, I did the project again with sklearn and got the same result.
I put the Diamond Project done with Python, statsmodel and sklearn in my github which you can find here:<br/>
https://github.com/jegali/DataScience/blob/main/Lesson-4/Lesson-4.ipynb<br/><br/>
:bulb: Finally I found the time to install KNIME, and I did not regret it so far. Its use is as simple as alteryx, not so stylish but can do the same and is free. Attached you see a screenshot of the diamond project. It gives me the same prediction like my python code and has the same deviation of 0,09% to alteryx. So I believe, alteryx uses a different algorithm which may cause the deviation.

<br/><br/>

## Day 26 - 2021-01-05
:bulb: As promised, I coded the example from lesson 3-22 "Building your First Model in Alteryx" in Python and statsmodel. If you are interested, have a look at the source code at:<br/>
https://github.com/jegali/DataScience/blob/main/Lesson-3-22/Lesson-3-22.ipynb<br/><br/>
:bulb: D26: I did the Diamond practice project in Python with statsmodel and think I'm close to the recommended solution. Instead of $8,230,695.69 I got $8,223,038.24. Pretty close, that's 99.91% with a deviation of 0.09%. I will check for an possible error tomorrow and try to get closer.
<br/><br/>

## Day 25 - 2021-01-04
:bulb: Today I learned Bayes theorem and Laplace probability theory. Besides that, I did the example from Lesson 3-22 in python with statsmodel with exactly the same result as before in alteryx. I will post the Python sourcecode tomorrow in my github. 
<br/><br/>

## Day 24 - 2021-01-03
:bulb: This was a day without coding. I read in my "Head First Statistics" book by O'reilly and learned about probabilities.
<br/><br/>

## Day 23 - 2021-01-02
:bulb: Today I learned the theorie behind boxplots and quartils. Good to know, you can use both to find outliers and make an educated guess about standard devation and variance.
<br/><br/>

## Day 22 - 2021-01-01
:bulb: Happy new year! I found out that there is a relationship between nominal, ordinal and metric data on the one hand and mode, median and arithmetic mean on the other. I was very fascinated by the ability to convert nominal data into ordinal data. Now I understand better the connection between dummy variables on the one hand and nominal data on the other. This will help me a lot in implementing the linear regression examples in python.
<br/><br/>

## Day 21 - 2020-12-31
:bulb: Today, I try something totally different: I have some spare raspberry Pis and connected them to a cluster. Now I try to parallelize the regression examples in python.<br/><br/>
:bulb: I finished a bootcamp on statisics and data science on udemy.

<br/><br/>

## Day 20 - 2020-12-30
:bulb: Today I did a case study in excel on portfolio management with mean value analysis, scatter analysis, correlation analysis, rank correlation, box plot, data classification and multi-regression analysis. Quite interesting to see a "real world scenario". 
<br/><br/>

## Day 19 - 2020-12-29
:bulb: I started a course on descriptive statistics with Excel. In the next days, I will transfer this knowledge to python.
<br/><br/>

## Day 18 - 2020-12-28
:bulb: I signed up to medium and read a lot of stuff. Did some experiments on dummy variables in python for a better understanding of multiple linear regression and played around with seaborn for visualization.
<br/><br/>

## Day 17 - 2020-12-27
:bulb: To bad, I realized that my slack account will delete older messages. I also found out that I cannot buy a slack account for me alone if other persons are in the channels to. So Slack wanted to charge me for a month for $17.000. I will have to reconstruct the days from Dec-11 to Dec-26 and my progress from my memory.<br/><br/>
:bulb: I still have no idea how to code dummy variables in Python. <br/><br/>
:bulb: Thank god, the next example from the udacity lesson is a multi-linear regression, but without nominal data, so I don't need any dummies.<br/>
https://github.com/jegali/DataScience/blob/main/lesson-3-12-multi-ticket-sample.ipynb
<br/><br/>

## Day 16 - 2020-12-26
:bulb: Today, I did the Udacity Lesson 3 Ticket example. I made some progress in using nice Python libraries which made my life more convenient. Have a look at the code here:<br/>
https://github.com/jegali/DataScience/blob/main/lesson-3-9-ticket-sample.ipynb
<br/><br/>

## Day 15 - 2020-12-25
:bulb: Ho ho ho! I tried to figure out some more of the math behind regression and learned about the sklearn and statsmodel package. So I fiddled around with some API calls and really like statsmodel now! <br/><br/>
:bulb: Making progress in the "Head First Statistics" book.<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>

## Day 14 - 2020-12-24
:bulb: It's beginning to look a lot like christmas! I extended the linear regression tutorial by a second part and did the math for correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination on my own. I learned how to read files instead of putting the calculation values in the Python script. Have a look at the results here:<br/>
https://github.com/jegali/DataScience/blob/main/linear_regression_2.ipynb
<br/><br/>

## Day 13 - 2020-12-23
:bulb: I tried some basic statistics in Python like word frequency counting and visualizing the results in a bar plot.<br/>
https://github.com/jegali/DataScience/blob/main/word_frequency.ipynb<br/><br/>
:bulb: I transferred the math used for linear regression in Python and did a first example of linear regression by hand. I wrote a short tutorial you can find here:<br>
https://github.com/jegali/DataScience/blob/main/linear_regression.ipynb<br/><br/>
:bulb: I finished reading the "Head First Data Analysis" book.<br/><br/>
:bulb: I started the "Head First Statustuics" book.
<br/><br/>

## Day 12 - 2020-12-22
:bulb: I fiddled around with Jupyter notebook and got a deeper understanding of this interactive version of python. I learned about the markdown language I can use in the notebooks and did some steps with numpy, scipy, matplotlib and sympy.
<br/><br/>

## Day 11 - 2020-12-21
:bulb: I have no alteryx license for my work laptop and will definetely not install software that has not been approved by our CIO. I found out that Python is allowed, so that was another important decision for my to switch from alteryx to python. I installed miniconda, since anaconda needs a paid license, which I do not have. I did some research on the packets installed with anaconda and decided to do my own "data sciene package". Here is what I did. First I downloaded miniconda and then I did some install on a console window:

```bash

# download miniconda from : https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
# After installation (you do not need any administrative right for that)
# open up a console window and type these commands
# to download and install the desired packages.
# Installation is interactive, so sometimes you have to type in "yes" or "no"

```

## Day 10 - 2020-12-20
:bulb: I understood the theory behind linear regression. I still do not know why it is called "machine learning". It simply calculates a regression formula which I can insert values in. Has nothing to do with "intelligent" or "learning", I think.
<br/><br/>

## Day 9 - 2020-12-19
:bulb: I started with a data science course on udemy but found out I need some more basics on statistics. I decided to learn about the math behind linear regression and did the calculation by hand in Excel.
<br/><br/>

## Day 8 - 2020-12-18
:bulb: I wanted to learn more about alteryx, so I did another course on udemy and passed today.
But I have to say, this course is not worth the money. If you get it discounted, it is ok.

<br/><br/>

## Day 7 - 2020-12-17
:bulb: I started another alteryx-course with some real world examples, but I was disappointed.
<br/><br/>

## Day 6 - 2020-12-16
:bulb: I passed my first alteryx course on udemy today.
This course is highly recommended!

![alteryx bootcamp](/images/udemy-alteryx-bootcamp.jpg)
<br/><br/>

## Day 5 - 2020-12-15
:bulb: I surfed the udemy website for some courses and guess what, they actually had discounts for alteryx courses. So I decided to deepen my knowledge in that tool.
<br/><br/>

## Day 4 - 2020-12-14
:bulb: I am still reading the "Head First" book.<br/><br/>
:bulb: I searched the web for some python installation and came across anaconda which I installed on my laptop. I fell in love with Jupyter Noteboks and decided to learn more about it.
<br/><br/>

## Day 3 - 2020-12-13
:bulb: Today I read my "Head First Data Analysis" book, which I started some time ago. I now have a much better unterstanding what's going on on the Data Track.
<br/><br/>

## Day 2 - 2020-12-12
:bulb: Since I did all the tasks and project with alteryx before I decided to do some research on O'reilly website and ordered two books from amazon concerning data science. I am looking forward to get and read them.
<br/><br/>

## Day 1 - 2020-12-11
:bulb: I did the pledge and joined the slack community for the 60 days of udacity challenge. I found a lot of learning material which I sorted and saved for further reading.
<br/><br/>
